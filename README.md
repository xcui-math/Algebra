### Policies

#### Homework

Homeworks will be assigned everyweek. The assigned problems are due every other Friday in-class. Students must make arrangements in advance if they will not be handing in homework on time. Please don't wait until the last hour to do the homework.

Each assignment will be graded out of 10 points: 5 points for making a good effort at completing each part of the homework, 2 points for technically-correctness in your solutions, and 3 points for clear descriptions, interpretations and explanations with easily recognizable handwritting.

You are encouraged to discuss about homeowork problems with others, but each one of you must write your own answers (using your own words). Copy and plagiarism will not be tolerated (see Academic Honesty policy).

#### Learning Cooperatively

With the exception of exams, we encourage you to discuss all of the course activities with your classmates as you are working on them. You will definitely learn more in this class if you work with others. Please ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally.

#### Academic Honesty

Collaborating on homework is fine but copying is NOT. At the same time, you should not share your homework answers directly with others. Please feel free to discuss the problems with others, but not the solutions. If you suspect other people may be plagiarizing you, let me know as soon as possible. 

Cheating in any form will be strictly prohibited. Anyone found cheating will get an 0 for the corresponding score, and will be reported to the students conduct center. If you are having trouble with assignments or studying for an exam, or if you are uncertain about permissible and impermissible conduct or collaboration, please come to me with your questions.

#### Email Policy

I encourage you to ask questions about the syllabus, covered material, and homeworks during lectures. However, if office hours conflict with your schedule, please use email to set up a one-on-one meeting with me.
